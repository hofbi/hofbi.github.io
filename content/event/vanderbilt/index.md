summary: "Invited talk at the Vanderbilt University about my research on adaptive video streaming for teleoperated driving"
abstract: "Failures of autonomous vehicles are inevitable. One possible solution to cope with these failures is teleoperated driving, where a human operator controls the vehicle from a remote environment. In this talk, we present adaptive video streaming for teleoperated driving, which provides the operator with the best possible situation awareness when controlling the vehicle from remote. For this, we designed a teledriving framework for the adaptation of individual camera views based on the current traffic situation. Additionally, we developed a preprocessing filter concept that allows for individual rate/quality adaptation while considering the hardware limitations of autonomous vehicles."
