# Test Driven Development

## Unit Tests

* Separate (non production) program/code to test your code
* Test your code on the lowest (unit) layer
* General 3 step structure of a unit test
  * **Given**: Setup unit and environment
  * **When**: Execute unit to test
  * **Then**: Test for expected result

### Why Tests

Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code

> “To me, legacy code is simply code without tests.”

---

## TDD

* Write your test before your production code
* 3 Phases
  * **Red Phase**: Define a failing test
  * **Green Phase**: Fix that test (Solve Simple)
  * **Refactoring**: Clean up your code
