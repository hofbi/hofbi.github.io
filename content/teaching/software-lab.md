Basic introduction to principles of software engineering including unit testing, test driven development, refactoring, CI, and automation.

## Paper

We published the paper [Teaching Software Engineering As Programming Over Time](/publication/software_lab) in the IEEE/ACM 4th International Workshop on Software Engineering Education for the Next Generation which contains further details on this course.

## Course Description

Software engineering skills of any engineer become more important with the ongoing digitization and automation. Software engineering means not only delivering an implementation that fulfills the requirements and generates correct results. A second highly important aspect is to deliver software that can be maintained by multiple contributors, over months, years or even decades. This lifetime aspect and the number of developers contributing to the software introduces additional requirements and challenges in the development process. Software has to be testable, readable, and extendable. Concepts such as unit tests, code reviews, and continuous integration support writing software with these characteristics.
