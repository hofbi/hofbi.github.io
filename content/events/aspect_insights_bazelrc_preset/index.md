title: Better Bazel Flag Defaults
event: Aspect Insights
event_url: https://events.linuxfoundation.org/bazelcon/

location: Online

summary: "Aspect Insights talk about how to improve Bazel flag defaults with the bazelrc-preset.bzl project."
abstract: "Bazel now has 776 command-line flags. Most users know maybe 5. In this episode, Markus Hofbauer from Zipline joins Alex to unpack the chaos of Bazel flags: why analysis cache discards still bite, how `--noallow_analysis_cache_discard` can save you time, and what the new [bazelrc-preset.bzl](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazelrc-preset.bzl) project does to bring order to BazelRC files. From flag flipping at Google scale to community-driven bug bounties, they cover real-world strategies for better defaults and explain why it's finally time to use common everywhere. If you're still hand-tuning Bazel flags in the dark, this is your flashlight. Want more? Check out: [bazelrc-preset.bzl](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazelrc-preset.bzl)"
