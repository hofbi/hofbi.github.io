summary: "Talk at BazelCon 2025 reviewing existing solutions for IDE support and developer tooling in monorepos using Bazel."
abstract: "Many developers complain about lacking IDE when working with Bazel. They might not care about using `bazel run` to execute tools but want use their tools available on the `PATH`. Providing tools on the `PATH` in addition to the ones used by the build system leads to extra effort for the teams maintaining this. In this talk, we review existing solutions available in the Bazel ecosystem: First and foremost, Fabianâ€™s project `bazel_env.bzl` which allows all developers to share the same tool versions as used in the Bazel build for IDEs and local usage. We demonstrate IDE support for C++ and Python in large monorepos by combining multiple projects such as hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor to generate a `compile_commands.json`, `hofbi/dev-tools` for the compile commands extractor to better scale with large codebases, and `clangd` to integrate with the IDE. To demonstrate all this, we have open-sourced a demo project at https://github.com/hofbi/bazel-ide. Of particular note is the devcontainer environment, which shows that this workflow requires only git, bazel, and `direnv` to be installed locally while everything else is provided and managed by the build system."
